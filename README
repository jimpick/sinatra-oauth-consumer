This is an experimental OAuth client
written in Python for use with the Sinatra
OAuth Provider:

  http://github.com/eddanger/sinatra-oauth-provider/tree/master

It's derived from Yahoo's Fire Eagle OAuth
tutorial.

Modify the SERVER to point to your server.

Once authenticated, it doesn't do much more than GET requests.

Cheers,
